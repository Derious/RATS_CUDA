RATS Library
===========

**R**andomness **A**uto-**T**est **S**uite (**RATS**) is a proof-of-concept implementation of the statistical test for random and pseudo-random number generators for cryptographic applications.

The following schemes are currently supported...

1. Frequency (Monobit) Test
2. Frequency Test within a Block 
3. Runs Test
4. Tests for the Longest-Run-of-Ones in a Block
5. Binary Matrix Rank Test
6. Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral) Test
7. Non-overlapping Template Matching Test
8. Overlapping Template Matching Test
9. Maurer's "Universal Statistical" Test
10. Linear Complexity Test
11. Serial Test
12. Approximate Entropy Test
13. Cumulative Sums (Cusums) Test
14. Random Excursions Test
15. Random Excursions Variant Test
